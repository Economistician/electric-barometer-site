Canonical public landing site for the Electric Barometer ecosystem.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the public-facing website for the Electric Barometer ecosystem. It serves as a stable landing surface that introduces Electric Barometer, provides navigational context, and links outward to documentation, papers, and related repositories.

The site is intentionally implemented as a static surface. It does not include application logic, dynamic rendering, or backend services. Its purpose is not to host tooling or interactive systems, but to act as a durable entry point that orients visitors and directs them to the appropriate authoritative sources within the broader ecosystem.

By keeping the site lightweight and dependency-free, this repository prioritizes longevity, clarity, and ease of maintenance while avoiding coupling to specific frameworks or build pipelines.

## Role in the Electric Barometer Ecosystem

This site functions as the **primary public entry point** for the Electric Barometer ecosystem. It provides a stable, neutral surface that introduces the project at a high level and routes visitors to the appropriate downstream resources, including documentation, technical papers, and source repositories.

The site does not serve as a system of record for technical definitions, implementation details, or evolving specifications. Those responsibilities are handled by dedicated repositories such as the documentation site and individual package or paper repositories.

By clearly separating **public orientation** from **technical authority**, this site maintains a lightweight role within the ecosystem while ensuring that canonical knowledge and evolving work remain anchored in their proper domains.

---

## Relationship to Documentation

This site is not intended to host or duplicate technical documentation. Authoritative definitions, frameworks, and evolving specifications for the Electric Barometer ecosystem are maintained within the dedicated documentation site.

The Electric Barometer documentation surface serves as the canonical source for technical detail and should be consulted for formal descriptions, implementation guidance, and supporting materials.

This repository links to the documentation where appropriate but deliberately avoids embedding or restating technical content to preserve a clear separation between public orientation and technical authority.
